# 🚀 Projo - Learn C by Building a Project Organizer

> A hands-on journey through C programming, one commit at a time.

**Projo** is both a learning project and a real command-line task organizer. Follow along as we build it from scratch across 25 modules, learning fundamental C concepts through practical application.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Memory management** with pointers and dynamic allocation
- **File I/O** for persistent data storage
- **Data structures** from arrays to linked lists and hash tables
- **Systems programming** with signals, processes, and networking
- **Professional practices** including testing, debugging, and cross-platform development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Git
- A terminal and text editor

### Try Module 1
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projo.git
cd projo

# Build and run the current version
gcc src/main.c -o projo
./projo

# Or try Module 1 specifically
cd modules/module-01
gcc main.c -o projo1
./projo1
```

## 📚 Learning Path

| Phase | Modules | Focus | Key Concepts |
|-------|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Foundations** | 1-5 | Basic C syntax | Variables, I/O, loops, functions |
| **Core Features** | 6-10 | Data structures | Structs, malloc/free, linked lists |
| **Advanced** | 11-15 | Architecture | Multi-file projects, configuration |
| **Professional** | 16-20 | Industry skills | Error handling, optimization, plugins |
| **Systems** | 21-25 | Low-level | Signals, concurrency, networking |

**Current Status**: Module 1 ✅ - [See all modules](ROADMAP.md)
